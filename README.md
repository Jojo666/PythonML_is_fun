# PythonML_is_fun

## ## This repo contains the Python code for a number of machine learniing algorithms such as Decision Trees and SVM.

## ## There is also code for artifical neural networks (ANN) and Deep Learning applications such as CNN. The deep learning applications have been demonstrated using the Keras library
